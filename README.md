# SAxense — DualSense Haptics over Bluetooth (POC)


### Usage (assuming DualSenses):
```sh
# Play a local file
ffmpeg -re -i /path/to/file.mp3 -ac 2 -ar 3000 -f s8 - | ./SAxense > $(ls /sys/devices/virtual/misc/uhid/0005:054C:0CE6.*/hidraw | sed 's|^|/dev/|')
# Capture loopback as haptics
pw-record -P '{ stream.capture.sink=true }' --format s8 --rate 3000 - | ./SAxense | ls /sys/devices/virtual/misc/uhid/0005:054C:0CE6.*/hidraw | sed 's|^|/dev/|' | xargs -or -- tee > /dev/null
```
> [!NOTE]
> Depending on your setup, you might experience some subtle delay (but up to couple seconds in some rare cases). It comes neither from SAxense nor HID/BT, but from the latency in capturing the loopback audio stream. Try `sox` or `ffmpeg` in such case, this might help reduce it. A native real-time PipeWire SPA plugin is on its way soon (this will also bring native games support for those already using it over UAC).

This POC has been R&D'd in under two weeks without having access to any documentation/sources or ever touching a PS (physical or remote). Was it really [that hard](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/51151098d7ab832f2a8b8f5c51fe224a9c98fdd5), Sony?

### Special thanks:
* @streetpea & a ‘someone else’ — for providing additional valuable [clues](https://github.com/streetpea/chiaki-ng/blob/0d26d1101e98e69adce100dd30e94eb7da8e1318/gui/src/streamsession.cpp#L1731) on the haptics PCM format.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **I kindly ask you to credit my research work (incl. [this link](https://apps.sdore.me/SAxense)) when implementing DS haptics support in your applications based on this work**, which is objectively the first one made available in free access, thus it seems pretty safe to assume that all non-affiliated parties would have to use/refer to it in some way, unless independently researched on their own.
> I'm not the kind of guy to ever run around pointing fingers accusing anyone of infringement, but proper credits will be greatly appreciated in any case.
